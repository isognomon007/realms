    <h1>The Enigmatic Forest</h1>

    <div id="story">
      <p>You awaken in a dense forest, surrounded by towering trees that seem to whisper ancient secrets. The air is crisp, carrying a hint of magic. As you stand up and gather your bearings, you realize you have no recollection of how you arrived in this mystical place.</p>

      <p>You notice a mysterious path splitting ahead, veering in two distinct directions.</p>

      <p>To the left, a narrow trail disappears into the depths of a dark grove, where shadows dance and linger in the still air. The forest floor is scarred by a tangle of gnarled roots, and an eerie aura emanates from within. The dark grove, drenched in mystery.</p>

      <p>To the right, a sunlit path opens up, with dappled light flickering through the foliage. The gentle murmur of rushing water hints at a secret waterfall or babbling brook nestled within the tranquility of the forest. The sunlit path, bright and airy.</p>

      <p>Which path will you choose?</p>
