    <!-- DONE -->
    <!-- Cautiously Retreat -->
    <div id="story">
      <p>
        Realizing the need for caution, you opt for a hasty retreat. 
        You take slow and deliberate steps backward, keeping a watchful eye on the black leopard. 
        Your senses remain heightened, acutely aware of any sudden movements. 
        Every fiber of your being urges you to create distance, to find safety in the familiarity of the path behind you. 
        Your retreat is measured and calculated, ensuring you maintain a safe distance while keeping the creature in your line of sight.
      </p>
      <p>
        With each step, you hasten your pace, the sound of your own footsteps echoing in your ears. 
        You navigate adeptly through the tangled undergrowth, determined to put distance between yourself and the wild animal.
        The woods seem to close in around you, and soon you can no longer sense the presence of the leopard. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As you continue your retreat, a sense of relief washes over you, knowing you have evaded the immediate danger. 
        Yet, a lingering sense of awe and curiosity remains, leaving you to wonder if you have not missed out 
        on a rare opportunity to learn more about these mysterious woods.
